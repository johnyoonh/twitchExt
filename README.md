A twitch extension for democratizing music.

## What this does
This is an extension that allows viewers of a twitch stream to collectively determine the music that the stream listens to. Rather than have everyone listen to their own music, this has people collectively choose what to listen to, and selectively recommends genres, artists and songs, improving the recommendations over time to build up a collective stream music brand.

## How it works
First, it recommends two genres. All viewers are then allowed to vote between the two genres. Then, it recommends two artists from the winning genres for people to select. People vote on the winning artist, and then two songs by that artist are presented. The song then plays, with a new round of voting starting 30 seconds before the end of the song. By continually recommending new songs and keeping track of vote totals and margins, the recommendations get better over time, building a music brand for the stream.
